<h2 align=center> Version Control System</h2>
</div><br>
Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code.

<br>Use of Version Control System:
<ul>
<li>A repository: It can be thought as a database of changes. It contains all the edits and historical versions (snapshots) of the project.</li>
<li>Copy of Work (sometimes called as checkout): It is the personal copy of all the files in a project. You can edit to this copy, 
without affecting the work of others and you can finally commit your changes to a repository when you are done making your changes.</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Local Version Control Systems:</i></b> It is one of the simplest forms and has a database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. RCS is one of the most common VCS tools. 
It keeps patch sets (differences between files) in a special format on disk. By adding up all the patches it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time.<br><br>

<h2 align=center>Basic Git Commands</h2>
</div>
<ul>
<li><b>git init</b><br>
This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. 
This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.</li><br>


<li><b>git add</b><br>
Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). 
There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.</li><br>


<li><b>git commit</b><br>
Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.

It’s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. 
Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.</li><br>



<li><b>git status</b><br>
This command returns the current state of the repository.</li><br><br>

<li><b>git status</b><br>It will return the current working branch. If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, 
it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes it’ll return nothing to commit, working directory clean.</li><br>




<li><b>git push</b><br>
The git push command is used to transfer or push the commit, which is made on a local branch in your computer to a remote repository like GitHub. 
The command used for pushing to GitHub is given below.
git push 'remote_name' 'branch_name'
In this tutorial, you'll be looking two different ways to PUSH to GitHub.</li><br>
